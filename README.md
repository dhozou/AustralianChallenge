# The Australian Challenge - [Forum Thread](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/the-australian-challenge.104763/)

The Australian Challenge turns Terraria on its head - literally. Upon generating a world you'll find yourself standing on a cloud above the deep blue sky. Inspired by the Gravity Globe, attempt to complete the game start to finish in reversed gravity. With the sky below and the Underworld above, experience the game from a whole new perspective!

This mod is a work in progress. Terraria has some limitations when played exclusively with reversed gravity, which this mod intends to address. Please report issues and mod incompatibilities here.

Special thanks to Aimuzion for suggesting the challenge that inspired this mod.
