# The Australian Challenge

The Australian Challenge turns Terraria on its head - literally. Upon generating a world you'll find yourself standing on a cloud above the deep blue sky. Inspired by the Gravity Globe, attempt to complete the game start to finish in reversed gravity. With the sky below and the Underworld above, experience the game from a whole new perspective!

This mod is a work in progress. Terraria places some limitations on what can be done upside down; this mod attempts to remove those restrictions. Please report any issues you encounter! The best way is creating an issue here on GitHub where it can be discussed and tracked. The Terraria Forum thread and Steam Workshop comments are also acceptable.

Special thanks to Aimuzion for the idea behind this mod.
